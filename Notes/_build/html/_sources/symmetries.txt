===================



The Invariant Quantity
------------------------

First of all I want to know what is not changed or what is the invariant quantity in a transformation.

There are three kind of common transformations.

1. Time translation: move the system in time. In this sense time translation is just the time evolution operator or propagator.
2. Space translation: move the system in space.
3. Gauge transformation

The invariance of them corresponds to:

1. Time translation invariance (T.T.I.) means the evolution of the system is not changing under time translations. **Hamiltonian is invariant.**
2. Space translation invariance (S.T.I.) means that the

**Definition of Time Translation**

Move the system in time.


**Generator of Time Translation**

T.T.I. is generated by Hamiltonian which can be easily understood by looking into Shcrödinger equation.

.. hint::
   Starting from Schrödinger equation,

   .. math::
      i\hbar \frac{\ket{\psi(t+\Delta t)} - \ket{\psi(t)}}{\Delta t} = H(t)\psi(t)

   Then we get the state after a evolution of time :math:`\Delta t`,

   .. math::
      \ket{\psi(t+\Delta t)} = \left( \hat I - i\frac{\Delta t \hat H(t)}{\hbar} \right) \ket{\psi(t)}

   Time translation symmetry means the state evolution in the same time interval :math:`\Delta t` no matter when to start the evolution. Mathematically,

   .. math::
      \ket{\psi(t_1 +\Delta t)} = \left( \hat I - i\frac{\Delta t \hat H(t_1)}{\hbar} \right) \ket{\psi(t_1)}

   should get the same final state if we start from some other time :math:`t_2`,

   .. math::
      \ket{\psi(t_2 +\Delta t)} = \left( \hat I - i\frac{\Delta t \hat H(t_2)}{\hbar} \right) \ket{\psi(t_2)}

   That means the two Hamiltonian should be the same. Now we reach the conclusion that Hamiltonian is time independent.


The logic is to prove that Hamiltonian is time independent by using infinitesimal time translation approach. Given that Hamiltonian is time independent, we imediately know that time translation operator is just the propagator with the form

.. math::
   \hat T_{\Delta t} \equiv \hat U(\Delta t) = e^{-i \hat H \Delta t /\hbar} 

All other conclusions come from the fact that Hamiltonian is a constant of motion.




.. hint::
   
   Ehrenfest theorem tells us that time independent Hamiltonian is a constant of motion.

   .. math::
      \frac{d}{dt}\avg{H} = \frac{1}{i\hbar}\avg{[\hat H, \hat H]} + \avg{\frac{\partial}{\partial t} H } = 0




.. important::

   For an isolated system, T.T.I. should always be satisfied because there is nothing more else to change the system but to leave the system with energy conserved.

   My concern is if we don't have an Hamiltonian for :math:`T\mathrm d S`, we can't actually says this because of what the second law of thermodynamics tells us.

S.T.I. is generated by canonical momentum. This is not so obvious as time translation. To prove this we need to understand what space translation really means.

**Definition of Space Translation**

Space translation means we change the position of the system by some spatial distance :math:`a`. In math this means a transformation from :math:`\ket{x}` to :math:`\ket{x+a}` where the plus sign is by definition. We invent this space translation operator,

.. math::
   \hat T_a  \ket{x} = \ket{x + a} .

**Space Translation Applied to States**

Next we can obtain the result of space translation operator applied to state in position basis

.. math::
   \bra{x}\hat T_a \ket{\psi} = (\bra{x}\hat T_a^\dagger) \ket{\psi} = \braket{x-a}{\psi} = \psi(x-a)

where we used the relation

.. math::
   (\bra{x} \hat T_a) =  (\hat T_a^\dagger \ket{x} )^\dagger = (\hat T _ {-a} \ket{x}  )^\dagger = (\ket{x-a})^\dagger = \bra{x-a}
   
which of course is because the normalization of coordinate basis tells us that space translation operator is unitary,

.. math::
   \braket{x+a}{x+a} = \bra{x}\hat T_a^\dagger \hat T_a \ket{x}


**Generator of Space Translation**

Similarly to time translation, we can find out the generator out of this definition. For infinitesimal translation,

.. math::
   -i\hbar \frac{\ket{\psi(x)} - \ket{\psi(x - \Delta)}}{\Delta} = \hat p \ket{\psi(x)}

i.e.,

.. math::
   \ket{\psi(x-\Delta)} = \ket{\psi(x)} - \frac{i\Delta}{\hbar} \ket{\psi(x)}

which shows that the generator of space translation is momentum operator.


**From Infinitesimal to Finite Space Translation**

.. math::
   \hat T_a = \lim _ {N\rightarrow \infty} \hat T _ {a/N} ^ N = \lim _{N\rightarrow\infty} \left( 1 - \frac{i\hat p}{\hbar} \frac{a}{N} \right)^N = exp\left( -\frac{i \hat p a}{\hbar} \right)

Now we have the explicity expression for space translation operators.


**Space Translation on Operators**

1. Use the invariant scalar -- inner product.
2. Passive vs Active



**Space Translational Invariance**

Space translational invariance of arbitary operator is

.. math::
   \hat \Omega = \hat T_a^\dagger \hat \Omega \hat T_a

is equivalent to

.. math::
   \hat T_a \hat \Omega = \hat \Omega \hat T_a \Rightarrow [\hat T_a, \hat Omega] = 0


We say some system has space translational invariance we mean the Hamiltonian is space translational invariant,

.. math::
   [\hat H , \hat T_a ] = 0 .

Such a system has space translational invariance.


.. hint::
   I once thought Hamiltonian is space/time translational invariant is not enough for the statement that the whole system is invariant under space or time translation for all observables. Of course I was wrong. Once the Hamiltonian and initial condition is given the whole system can be determined completely in principle.
